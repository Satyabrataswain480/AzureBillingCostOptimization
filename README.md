üß† Design Details
üî∏ Hot Tier (Provisioned Throughput)
Stores records from the last 3 months

Optimized for frequent queries

üî∏ Cold Tier (Serverless)
Stores records older than 3 months

Pay-per-request billing, low cost

üî∏ Archiver Function
Triggered by Cosmos DB Change Feed

Moves data from Hot ‚ûù Cold based on timestamp

üî∏ Query Proxy
Unified function that:

First checks Hot tier

Falls back to Cold tier if record isn‚Äôt found

Keeps client APIs unchanged

üî∏ Indexing & Caching
Disable unnecessary indexing on Cold tier to save RU/s

Optionally use Azure Cache for Redis for hot paths on cold data

üìö Required NuGet Packages
Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos

Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker

Microsoft.Extensions.Logging


---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Cosmos DB Containers
- **Hot Container**: Provisioned throughput (e.g., 10,000 RU/s)
- **Cold Container**: Serverless mode for pay-per-request billing

### 2. Data Archival Logic
Use Azure Functions triggered by Cosmos DB's Change Feed to move records older than three months from the Hot to the Cold container.


### 3. Unified Query Logic
Azure Function to route queries to either Hot or Cold container based on availability.


### 4. Optimize Indexing Policy
- **Cold Container**:
  - Exclude non-critical fields
  - Use lazy indexing on rarely queried fields

### 5. Implement Caching (optional)
- Use **Azure Cache for Redis**
  - Cache frequently accessed historical records
  - Reduce direct Cold Tier queries

Validation and Monitoring
- Use Azure Monitor to track RU/s consumption and storage costs across containers.
- Set up alerts for unexpected spikes in cold-container requests.
- Perform load testing to ensure the proxy function adds minimal latency (<500 ms).


## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Cost Optimization
- Hot container handles active queries with provisioned throughput
- Cold container reduces cost via serverless pricing for infrequent access

### ‚úÖ Seamless Transition
- Automated archival ensures no downtime
- Query proxy logic keeps API contracts unchanged

### ‚úÖ Performance
- Cached responses for old records
- Fast reads for current data

### ‚úÖ Scalability
- Cosmos DB supports horizontal partitioning
- Tiering ensures long-term growth control

## Summary
This Cosmos DB tiered solution balances performance and cost by smartly separating active and historical billing data. It requires no changes to API interfaces and provides a robust path to scalability and operational efficiency.

Why Cosmos DB Serverless Instead of Azure Storage?
Azure Cosmos DB is better suited for this scenario due to its rich querying capabilities, automatic indexing, and ability to handle structured data efficiently. Azure Storage, while cost-effective for unstructured data (e.g., blobs), lacks the querying features and consistency models required for seamless integration into your current system without changes to API contracts.

Key Advantages of Cosmos DB Serverless:
Cost Efficiency: Serverless mode charges only for Request Units (RUs) consumed during operations, making it ideal for storing rarely accessed historical records.

Querying Capabilities: Cosmos DB supports SQL-like queries, allowing seamless access to archived records without modifying the API.

Ease of Integration: Using Cosmos DB serverless ensures minimal architectural changes since both hot and cold containers remain within the same database ecosystem.

Why Not Azure Storage?
Azure Storage is primarily designed for unstructured data and lacks built-in query capabilities. Retrieving data from Azure Storage typically requires direct access via keys, which would necessitate changes to your API contracts and complicate implementation. Additionally, Azure Storage does not support features like automatic indexing or partitioning that are critical for handling structured billing records efficiently.

Thus, the solution remains within the Cosmos DB ecosystem by utilizing serverless mode for cost optimization while maintaining simplicity and compatibility with your existing architecture.

Optional Solutions:

üåó Hybrid Model: 3-Tier Data Storage for Billing Records
This model adds a third, deep-cold tier (Blob Storage) for long-term historical data. Here‚Äôs how it works:

üß± Storage Tiers
Tier	Storage Type	Data Age	Purpose
Hot Tier	Cosmos DB (provisioned throughput)	Last 3 months	Fast read/write for active data
Warm Tier	Cosmos DB (serverless)	3‚Äì12 months	Moderate access, reduced cost
Cold Tier	Azure Blob Storage (Cool or Archive tier)	Older than 12 months	Very infrequent access, ultra-low cost
üîÑ Data Flow
1. Write Path
All billing records initially land in the Hot Tier Cosmos DB container.

2. Archival to Warm Tier (3 Months)
Use Change Feed or Timer-Triggered Azure Function to move records >3 months old to the Warm Tier container (Cosmos DB serverless).

After verifying successful move, delete from hot container.

3. Deep Archival to Cold Tier (12 Months)
Use another time-triggered Azure Function to move records >12 months from warm tier to Blob Storage.

Optionally compress the files (.json.gz, .parquet) and structure them by date:
/billing/YYYY/MM/.

Add metadata to Azure Table Storage or Search Index for lookup.

üîÑ Read Path (Unified Query Logic)
All reads go through a read proxy layer (e.g., Azure Function), with routing logic:

Check Hot Tier (provisioned Cosmos DB)

If not found, check Warm Tier (serverless Cosmos DB)

If not found, check Blob metadata index, then fetch from Blob Storage

Return response to client ‚Äì same format, no contract change

You can add caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce repeated cold lookups.

üí∞ Cost Impact by Tier
Tier	Cost	Notes
Hot	$$$	RU-intensive, but needed for performance
Warm	$$	Cosmos DB serverless is cheaper, pay-per-request
Cold	$	Blob Storage costs ~90% less than Cosmos DB
Blob cost examples (2025 estimates, region-dependent):

Blob Storage Cool Tier: ~$0.01/GB/month

Cosmos DB Serverless: ~$0.25 per million RUs

You could see 50‚Äì70% overall cost reduction over time.

üîê Optional Enhancements
Azure Data Factory or Synapse Pipelines for large batch archival.

Blob Storage Lifecycle Policy: auto-transition blobs to Archive tier.

Monitoring: Log telemetry and track archive job failures.
