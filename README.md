# AzureBillingCostOptimization

To address the cost optimization challenge for managing billing records in Azure Cosmos DB within a serverless architecture, the proposed solution leverages data tiering, automated archiving, and transparent query routing.


**Solution Overview**
This solution involves creating a tiered architecture using hot and cold containers within Azure Cosmos DB, leveraging provisioned throughput and serverless modes for cost optimization. It ensures seamless data access, no downtime, and no changes to API contracts.

Implementation Steps
1. Create Cosmos DB Containers
Hot Container: Configure with provisioned throughput (e.g., 10,000 RU/s).

Cold Container: Use serverless mode for pay-per-request billing.

2. Data Archival Logic
Use Azure Functions triggered by Cosmos DBâ€™s change feed to move records older than three months from the hot container to the cold container.
